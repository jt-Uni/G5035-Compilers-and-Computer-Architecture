# G5035-Compilers-and-Computer-Architecture

## Module introduction

Compilers are programs that translate programs from a source language to a target language. Typically, the target language is low level (e.g., x86 or RISC-V machine code) and directly executable on a processor or a virtual machine. In contrast, the source language is usually high-level (e.g. Java, Haskell, Rust, Swift, Scala, or C), not directly executable on machines, and designed to be usable by humans.

In other words, compilers bridge the abstraction gap between high-level languages that are convenient for us to use, and low-level languages that can be executed efficiently by machines. Compilers are arguably the most important tool for programmers, and consequently, much effort has been expended since the dawn of the age of computing to produce high-quality compilers. Modern compilers are marvels of technology and typically, thousands of person-years are invested in the production of a state-of-the-art compiler.
